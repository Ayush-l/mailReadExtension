# mailReadExtension

#Intution
We used a button and appended at the end of body of Mail. When the receiver will press the button it will hit URL generated by server.js ans we can use this as the indicator for whether the mail is read or not.

#Alternative
We could have used an invisible pixel at the end of body to check whether the mail is opened or not. But this comes up with 2 problems 
1. The image is opened in sender's end too when the sender is sending the mail moreover it will be opened everytime when the sender will open their mail.
2. Gmail downloads the pixel from sender's end and does not hit the url from receiver's end.

#BackEnd
    We wrote backend in Spring Boot(Java based BackEnd frameword).
    Created a class called mail to register all the mails send by user.
    #Services
        Package containing all the service classes made.
        #MailService.java
            It contains 3 functions.
                a. isVisited()-> It returns -1 if the record is not present in database, return 1 if receiver has receiver has seen the mail and return 0 if receiver hasn't seen the mail.
                b. visit()-> It changes the status of the mail id to visited using the boolean variable named visit.
                c. createMail()-> It create a new Mail in database with visit=false and id's value taken as parameter.
    #Controllers
        Package containing all the api-endpoints
        #MailController.java
            It contains 3 api endpoints.
                a. /mail/create/{id}-> it is the api endpoint for creating a new mail class with parameter id.
                b. /mail/visit/{id}-> it is the api endpoint for marking the mail classObjects as visited.
                c. /mail/isvisited/{id}-> it is the api endpoint for checking whether the mail has been seen or not.
