# mailReadExtension

#Intution
We used a button and appended at the end of body of Mail. When the receiver will press the button it will hit URL generated by server.js ans we can use this as the indicator for whether the mail is read or not.

#Alternative
We could have used an invisible pixel at the end of body to check whether the mail is opened or not. But this comes up with 2 problems 
1. The image is opened in sender's end too when the sender is sending the mail moreover it will be opened everytime when the sender will open their mail.
2. Gmail downloads the pixel from sender's end and does not hit the url from receiver's end.
